# Cascade Dynamics in Cost Networks

This project compares **4 approaches to Cascade Dynamics in Cost Networks**.

The main focus is on the problem of finding the most influential set of nodes in a network, given a budget constraint, a cost function that assigns a cost to each node, and a threshold function that determines the activation of a node.

The **4 approaches**, which are later discussed in greater details, are:
1. Degree.
2. Degree / Cost.
3. Genetic algorithm (random).
4. Genetic Degree / Cost algorithm.
